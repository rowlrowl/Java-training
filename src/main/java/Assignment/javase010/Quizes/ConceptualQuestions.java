    1. Method overloading happens when different methods have the same name but different parameters while
        method overriding is where a child class has a different implementation of the method it inherited
        from its parent class.

        //method overloading
        public static int add(int a, int b){
            return a+b;
        }
        public static int add(int a, int b, int c){
            return a+b+c
        }

        //method overriding
        public class Staff{
            public void showWork(){
                System.out.prinln("I am a teacher")
            }
        }
        public class Manager extends Staff{
            public void showWork(){
                System.out.println("I am a manager")
            }
        }
    

    2. Fields should be declared private to prevent other classes from accessing them and to provide
        controlled access through getter methods.

    3. The super keyword is used when you want to access the parent class's methods or variables if accessible.
            super.showWork();  //prints "I am a teacher"

    4. The override notation makes your code more readable and allows the compiler to check if the method being
        overridden actually exists in the parent class.
    
    5. Encapsulation involves code maintainability. Since outside classes are not able to access the private fields
        we could more easily edit the internal code without affecting the external implementation.
